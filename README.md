# PersonalActivityMonitori


This python script is intended to take periodic screen shots at an interval of every 20 seconds of the desktop, allowing me to track the day's activity. It is invoked using the noh command allowing it to run as a background process and it automatically quits after running 1620 ( 9 hours at 3 shots per minute)  shots.
